‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the AI Interview Coach running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ai-interview-coach.git](https://github.com/your-username/ai-interview-coach.git)
cd ai-interview-coach

2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: If you don't have a requirements.txt file yet, you can create one by running pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing the necessary libraries like streamlit and groq.)

4. Configure Your API Key
This project requires a Groq API key.

Create a folder named .streamlit in the root of your project directory.

Inside this folder, create a file named secrets.toml.

Add your Groq API key to the secrets.toml file like this:

GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

Important: The .gitignore file is already configured to ignore the .streamlit/secrets.toml file, ensuring your API key is not accidentally pushed to GitHub.

5. Run the Streamlit App
Launch the application from your terminal:

streamlit run app.py

Your web browser should open with the application running!
