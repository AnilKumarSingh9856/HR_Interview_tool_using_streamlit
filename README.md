## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A Groq API Key. You can get one for free from the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-interview-coach.git
    cd ai-interview-coach
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    This keeps your project dependencies isolated.
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure your API Key:**
    The application uses Streamlit's built-in secrets management.

    - Create a directory named `.streamlit` in your project's root folder.
    - Inside `.streamlit`, create a file named `secrets.toml`.
    - Add your Groq API key to this file as shown below:

    ```toml
    # .streamlit/secrets.toml
    GROQ_API_KEY = "gsk_YourGroqApiKeyHere"
    ```
    Your `.gitignore` file is already correctly configured to prevent this file from being committed to Git.
